### Hi there 👋
My name is Joshua Moore, at the moment I am studying to become a software developer.<br>
I am extremely excited about this road I am currently going down and the impacts that it can have on my family.
I have always thrived being around technology and have had a very strong love for working through problems to have
a better understanding of the how and why behind why the scenes. 

I have years of management experience and as well as tech support which I think will make me a valuble resource 
to any team. I am driven, motivated, and ready for what is to come.
